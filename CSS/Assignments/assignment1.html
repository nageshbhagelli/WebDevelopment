    <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
    <h3>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
    <p>
      I met a traveller from an antique land, <br / > who saidâ€”"Two vast and
      trunkless legs of stone<br />
      Stand in the desert. . Near them, on the sand, <br />half sunk a shattered
      visage lies, whose frown, <br / > and wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold
      command, <br / > tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br / >
      which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br / > the hand that
      mocked them, and the heart that fed; <br / > and on the pedestal, these
      words appear : <br / > my name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, King of
      Kings;<br / > look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br / > nothing
      beside remains. Round the decay<br / > of that colossal Wreck, boundless
      and bare<br / > the Ione and level sands stretch far away. "<br / >
    </p>
